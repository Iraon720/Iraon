        <!-- TODO: talk about 1st hobby-->
        <p>
          Growing up in the small country town of Willacoochee, Ga we had to
          create our own fun outside of playing video games. I grew up watching
          my uncles and cousins race their bikes against each other or people
          from out of town. I started learning how to operate all types of
          vehicles early on from dirt bikes,cars,four-wheelers, big trucks, and
          buses.When I reached highschool my uncles finally allowed me to ride
          their motorcyles

        <h2>Gym</h2>
        <!-- TODO: talk about 2nd hobby-->
        <p>
          Growing up I really loved sports. Me and my cousins would play
          football, basketball, or baseball everyday no matter the weather. When
          we started playing sports for our middle school, we were required to
          go lift weights to prepare for highschool. Instead of it becoming
          something I had to do, it became something I really wanted to do. I
          loved how my body was transforming being that I was a greedy fat kid
          who loved eating. Once I graduated highschool I stopped going for the
          first 2 years of college. Once I started back going I realized working
          out was a great way to relieve stress and plus I was just partying and
          eating so I had gained all that weight back. Now it is one of my main
          hobbies, no matter where I am or how busy I am I have to go the gym
          for at least an hour a day.I love getting stronger, releiving stress,
          and the pain that I feel after a great workout.
