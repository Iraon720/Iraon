        <p>
          Growing up in the small country town of Willacoochee, Ga we had to
          create our own fun outside of playing video games. I grew up watching
          my uncles and cousins race their bikes against each other or people
          from out of town. I started learning how to operate all types of
          vehicles early on from dirt bikes,cars,four-wheelers, big trucks, and
          buses.When I reached highschool my uncles finally allowed me to ride
          their motorcyles
