        <h2>Ride Motorcyle</h2>

        <!-- TODO: talk about 1st hobby-->
        <p>
          Growing up in the small country town of Willacoochee, Ga we had to
          create our own fun outside of playing video games. I grew up watching
          my uncles and cousins race their bikes against each other or people
          from out of town. I started learning how to operate all types of
          vehicles early on from dirt bikes,cars,four-wheelers, big trucks, and
          buses.When I reached highschool my uncles finally allowed me to ride
          their motorcyles and I became addicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          My junior year of highschool I had my first wreck. You would think
          that would stop me from riding, but it didn't it made me want to ride
          even more. Even after all the doctor appointments and meeting with a
          plastic surgeon I coudln't wait to ride again.It is probably my second
          favorite hobby because of how peaceful and free I feel when I ride.
          You have nothing to do but think, and enjoy how beautiful earth is.

        <h2>Gym</h2>
        <!-- TODO: talk about 2nd hobby-->
        <p>
          Growing up I really loved sports. Me and my cousins would play
          football, basketball, or baseball everyday no matter the weather. When
          we started playing sports for our middle school, we were required to
          go lift weights to prepare for highschool. Instead of it becoming
          something I had to do, it became something I really wanted to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I loved how my body was transforming being that I was a greedy fat kid
          who loved eating. Once I graduated highschool I stopped going for the
          first 2 years of college. Once I started back going I realized working
          out was a great way to relieve stress and plus I was just partying and
          eating so I had gained all that weight back. Now it is one of my main
          hobbies, no matter where I am or how busy I am I have to go the gym
          for at least an hour a day.I love getting stronger, releiving stress,
          and the pain that I feel after a great workout.
        </p>

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <!-- TODO: talk about 3rd hobby-->
        <p>
          As a kid growing up in the country, another thing to do for fun was
          playing video games. There were so many types of games and consoles
          out that almost every one I knew had one. As a kid playing games were
          just for fun,and to keep your attention. When I got older I noticed
          that playing games were not just only fun but yet another great way to
          decompress from everything going on.
        </p>
        <p>
          It became even better over the years because of the ability to play
          with friends online and also cross play with different consoles.
          Another reason I love playing is because they make games for different
          movies, popular anime, and books.
